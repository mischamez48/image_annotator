# DigitalSreeni Image Annotator - Project Summary

## 🎯 Project Overview

This is an enhanced version of the **DigitalSreeni Image Annotator** by Dr. Sreenivas Bhattiprolu (@DigitalSreeni) with significant improvements and new features. The project is based on the original work and adds additional functionality while preserving all original capabilities. The project is now ready for GitHub distribution and easy installation on any computer.

> **Important**: This is a fork/enhancement of the original [DigitalSreeni Image Annotator](https://github.com/bnsreenu/digitalsreeni-image-annotator) by Dr. Sreenivas Bhattiprolu. All original functionality is preserved with additional features added on top.

## ✨ Key Enhancements Made (Added to Original)

### 1. Multiple SAM-2 Prompt Modalities
- **Points**: Left-click for positive points, right-click for negative points
- **Bounding Boxes**: Click and drag to draw rectangles
- **Masks**: Click and drag to draw custom shapes
- Real-time SAM-2 inference with visual feedback

### 2. Enhanced Merge Functionality
- Properly merges different annotation types (rectangles with polygons)
- Converts all annotations to Shapely polygons before merging
- Maintains geometric accuracy during merge operations

### 3. Improved User Experience
- Better keyboard shortcuts (Enter, Esc, C key)
- Visual status messages for different modalities
- Consistent behavior across all prompt types
- Clear visual feedback for all interactions

### 4. Easy Installation & Distribution

- **Manual annotations** with polygons and rectangles
- **Paint brush and Eraser tools** with adjustable pen sizes
- **Save and load projects** for continued work
- **Import/Export** in multiple formats (COCO JSON, YOLO v8/v11, Labeled images, etc.)
- **Multi-dimensional image support** (TIFF stacks and CZI files)
- **Zoom and pan** for detailed annotations
- **Multiple classes** with customizable colors
- **Dark mode** support
- **YOLO training** capabilities
- **Area measurements** for annotations
- **Additional tools**: Dataset splitter, image augmenter, DICOM converter, and more
